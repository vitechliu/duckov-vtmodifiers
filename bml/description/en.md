### Update 0.5.0

- For situations where duplicate affixes are displayed (such as precise precise AK47), patches have been added to avoid them, but please note that this is not a bug. If you encounter this issue, it means that your mod has been used too much! Some mods have caused duplicate loading issues!

- Note:
1. The probability of equipment with those affixes in the Crafting/Loot box is 75%, and the probability of enemy weapons being 40%
2. When enemies (even bosses) are generated, they may carry powerful weapons, be careful not to be killed in seconds!
3. If there are bugs or conflicts with other popular mods, please leave a message for feedback! Give a thumbs up to the ducks who think it's good! Thank you all!
