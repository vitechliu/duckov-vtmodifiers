press Ctrl+F3 to open the mod configuration menu

### Update 0.5.0
- Now melee weapons also support Modifiers!
- Added the 'Fixed Attribute' switch, which will fix the affix attribute to its maximum value when turned on.
- Fixed the issue of adding modifiers to the armor of the dummy in the base (no wonder the armor penetration test is inaccurate)
- Now compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3595729494]ModSetting[/url] mod allows for more convenient modification of parameters
- For situations where duplicate affixes are displayed (such as precise precise AK47), patches have been added to avoid them, but please note that this is not a bug. If you encounter this issue, it means that your mod has been used too much! Some mods have caused duplicate loading issues!

### Update 0.4.3
- Reduce all armor enhancement values by half;
- About adjustment for armor and damage values has been added to the configuration menu. If you feel it is too strong/weak, you can manually adjust it. [b] You need to restart the game to take effect! [/b]
- Fixed the situation where some original versions displayed two decimal places as one decimal place (totem)

### Update 0.4.2
- Now press Ctrl+F3 to open the mod configuration menu
- Fixed the issue that caused negative affixes with red to turn white in item attribute display, and now the numerical part will not turn purple.
- Fixed the issue of unlimited bullets and firing rate for aircraft when playing with Mr Sans' Multiplayer mod!
- Fixed the issue of missing affixes in some modifiers;

- Note:
1. The probability of equipment with those affixes in the Crafting/Loot box is 75%, and the probability of enemy weapons being 40%
2. When enemies (even bosses) are generated, they may carry powerful weapons, be careful not to be killed in seconds!
3. If there are bugs or conflicts with other popular mods, please leave a message for feedback! Give a thumbs up to the ducks who think it's good! Thank you all!
