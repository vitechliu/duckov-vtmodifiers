Loot boxes, enemy equipment, crafted equipment, etc. will now be randomly attached with Modifier! Start Farming!

Update 0.0.4-10/30, weapons crafted now will also have Modifier!
Note:
1.The probability of equipment with those affixes in the Crafting/Loot box is 75%, and the probability of enemy weapons being 40%
2. When enemies (even bosses) are generated, they may carry powerful weapons, be careful not to be killed in seconds!
3. If there are bugs or conflicts with other popular mods, please leave a message for feedback! Give a thumbs up to the ducks who think it's good! Thank you all!
